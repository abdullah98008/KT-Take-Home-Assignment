1.First conisder Requriemnt document as SRS.pdf

2.Secondly consider UI Frame folder as Desgin Document which is Design Document for KT Take Home Assignment.docx

3.Now we list down all the requirements one by one with desgins screen in Requirements Tracebility Matrix Document and listing should be in this way that each requirement consist of unquie code 

eg: (CompanyName-DOC Name -Requriment Name-Requriment Count Number) which will become KT-SRS-Searchlanding-01 .

 3.1 For Testcases (CompanyName-DOC Name -Requriment Name-Requriment Count Number -TestCase -TestCase Count Number ).
 3.2 For Bug Report ID (CompanyName-DOC Name -Requriment Name-Requriment Count Number -Bug-Bug Count Number ).
 3.3 For Git column we need to put the git hash code of that requirement (comment must contain Requirement ID)

4. Testcase Document contains all the testcases with requirements and also with testcase status either they are pass while testing or fail. Testcases those got fail there
BUG ID has been generated in RTM document and after testing there status has been updated. 

Question: Why I used the tracebility matrix?
Answer: 1) The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a document that links requirements throughout the validation process. 
		2) The purpose of the Requirements Traceability Matrix is to ensure that all requirements defined for a system are tested in the test protocols.
		3) And this document provide the best way you can track your CODE in the GIT by using the requirement id.
